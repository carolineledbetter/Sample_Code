# BIOS6623Class

This folder contains the project materials for BIOS6623 minus datasets.  The datasets are not in this repository because you never know when data contains sensitive information. So, we want to minimize the risk that data could be accidentally shared. We have created folder templates for all projects. These provide one way of organizing work in an common framework.

For this class, the datasets can be found on CANVAS.

This is the repository of Caroline Ledbetter. To change this file, I pulled the repo and edited it locally. Also, I changed my system preferences so markdown files open with text editor instead of Xcode. I then pushed it back to github and made comments about my changes. 

My name is Caroline and I am a second year in the MPH program. I very much enjoy the intersection of coding and statistical analysis. This summer I did an independent study on machine learning and I am very interested in advanced statistical techniques.
